# Study 1: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis {#lit-review}
To understand the contribution of TEs to bilingual word learning, we conducted a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis on the proportion of TE pairs in bilingual children's vocabulary.

## Search strategy
We conducted a search across a set of academic databases (PubMed, PsycNet, Directory of Open Access Journals, Google Scholar). 
We used the PICOS search strategy [@schardtUtilizationPICOFramework2007] to inform our search.
The population of interest was typically developing bilingual[^02-01] children of age 0;0--8;0.[^02-02]
The phenomena of interest involved any predictors that affect the distribution of TE pairs known by a child (_which_ pairs and _how many_ pairs). 
We included experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies, and excluded reviews or single case studies.

[^02-01]: We did not specify a criterion for qualification as "bilingual"; instead, we accepted whichever criteria were adopted by the original authors.

[^02-02]: The age cutoff was arbitrary, but allowed for the inclusion of studies which had fairly large age ranges.

The search terms we used were:

* "bilingual\*";
* "child\*" OR "infant\*" OR "toddler\*"; and 
* "translation(al) equivalen\*" OR "cross-language synonym\*" OR "cross-linguistic synonym\*" OR "doublet\*" OR "conceptual vocabulary"

We also identified additional papers through citation searching and by consulting experts in the field. 

Altogether, we identified 48 papers which satisfied our selection criteria, of which 23 discussed phenomena related to the TE pairs known by a child; these were included in our literature review. 
These 48 papers also included 84 measurements which measured TE pairs, of which 35 had sufficient accessible data regarding the proportion of TE pairs in a child's vocabulary; these were included in our meta-analysis. 

The PRISMA flow diagram [@pagePRISMA2020Statement2021] is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:prisma).

## Systematic literature review
For each paper, we coded the languages spoken by at least 10% of participants in the paper.[^02-03]
The counts of languages represented in the reviewed papers are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:lang-count).

[^02-03]: Some studies included participants who spoke a wide variety of languages, and this cutoff helped to remove languages that were represented by only a very small number of participants. 

(ref:lang-count-cap) Counts of languages represented in included reports.
```{r lang-count, out.width="100%", fig.cap="(ref:lang-count-cap)"}
data_df <- read_csv("data/misc/ma_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(dominance = (50 - `Mean L2 exp`) / 100)
lang_list <- list()
for (i in data_df$Langs) {
  lang_list <- c(lang_list, str_split(i, ","))
}
lang_list <- lang_list |> unlist()
lang_count <- lang_list |> table() |> as_tibble()
ggplot(data = lang_count, 
       aes(x = reorder(lang_list, -n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Language")
```

Unsurprisingly, English was the best-represented language ($n =$ `r lang_count |> filter(lang_list == "eng") |> pull(n)`), followed by Spanish ($n =$ `r lang_count |> filter(lang_list == "spa") |> pull(n)`) and French ($n =$ `r lang_count |> filter(lang_list == "fra") |> pull(n)`), which are common languages spoken by bilinguals in the United States and Canada respectively. 
Importantly, these languages are also all Indo-European, and thus have relatively smaller linguistic distance and considerable overlap in terms of cognates. 
There is little, if any, representation from other languages, which limits the generalisability of the reported findings, and provides an impetus for more diverse research in this field. 

With that caveat in mind, we investigated the predictors affecting the distribution of TE pairs known by a child.
As a preliminary observation, almost all bilingual children across all reports do know a non-zero proportion of TE pairs. 
While this finding seems trivial, it refutes earlier suggestions that bilingual children have a single 'fused' lexicon, and therefore reject acquiring TEs [e.g., @volterraAcquisitionDevelopmentLanguage1978; cf. discussions in @holowkaSemanticConceptualKnowledge2002; @pearsonCrosslanguageSynonymsLexicons1995]. 
The existence of TE pairs in bilingual children's vocabularies thus suggests that they do possess two language systems that are at least somewhat separable. 
Furthermore, bilingual children exhibit substantial variability in their proportion of TE pairs [e.g., @frankYoungMonolingualBilingual2002; @junkerExpressiveVocabularyGermanEnglish2002; @rinkerRelationshipFirstLanguage2017]; this is unsurprising, given the variability of language experience across children. 
A number of studies have thus sought to explain some of this variability by exploring the relationship of TE pairs to age, language exposure, and cognacy. 

### TEs and age
Longitudinally, proportion of TE pairs increases across development [@davidIndividualDifferencesLexical2008; @legacyDogChienTranslation2017; @woodsDevelopmentTranslationEquivalents2013]. 
In fact, knowledge of a word in one language predicts knowledge of its TE in the other language at a subsequent time step [@goodrichDevelopmentTransferVocabulary2016; @mancilla-martinezGrowthToddlersSpanish2013]. 
Cross-sectionally, older children also exhibit a greater proportion of TE pairs than younger children [@tareCanYouSay2010; @tsuiAreTranslationEquivalents2022]. 

### TEs and language exposure
Bilingual children with more balanced language exposure have a greater proportion of TE pairs [@davidIndividualDifferencesLexical2008; @legacyDogChienTranslation2017; @pearsonCrosslanguageSynonymsLexicons1995]. 
Proportion of TE pairs also seems to be related to exposure in the non-dominant language [@poulin-duboisLexicalAccessVocabulary2013; but see @legacyVocabularySizeTranslation2016]. 
The context of the language exposure is also important, with more TEs being learnt when both languages are spoken in the same settings [@pearsonPatternsInteractionLexical1994; @umbelMeasuringBilingualChildren1992]. 
Additionally, TE pairs were correlated with intra-sentential code-switching in caregivers of bilingual children, but not in inter-sentential code-switching [@bailLookGatoCodeswitching2015; @smolakCodeswitchingYoungBilingual2020]. 

### TEs and cognacy.
TEs also seem to be related to cognacy, most commonly operationalised as the amount of phonological overlap between two words. 
Indeed, there appears to be a cognate advantage in learning TEs, such that words with greater phonological overlap are more likely to be TE pairs [@grassoCrossLinguisticCognateProduction2018; @umbelMeasuringBilingualChildren1992]. 
In parallel, bilingual children produce more TE pairs that are cognate than TE pairs that are noncognate [@boschFirstTranslationEquivalents2014; @mitchellCognatesAreAdvantaged2022; @umbelMeasuringBilingualChildren1992]. 

### Summary
Overall, TEs appear to be an important and special part of bilingual word learning.
TE pairs also vary significantly across children, and factors including age, language exposure, and cognacy affect the distribution of TE pairs known by children.

## Meta-analysis
### Coding
For each measurement for which data was available, we coded the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of TE pairs, either from values directly reported in the paper, or values calculated from data associated with the paper. 
We also coded the number of participants, and potential moderator variables including the mean age of participants in months, the mean proportion exposure to the non-dominant language, the vocabulary measure (comprehension or production), as well as the instrument used to measure children's vocabularies. 

### Analysis
All analysis was conducted using the `metafor` package [@viechtbauerConductingMetaanalysesMetafor2010] in R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2022], with visualisations using the `meta` package [@balduzziHowPerformMetaanalysis2019]. 
We used multilevel mixed effects models with groupings for report and participant group (for measurements which had the same, overlapping, or potentially overlapping participants). 

Because some of the measure--instrument combinations included only a small number of reports ($n \leq 2$), we did not include measure or instrument as moderator variables. 
To investigate the role of age, we conducted a subsequent meta-analysis on the subset of measurements using the CDI to measure expressive vocabulary ($n = 29$), including age as a moderator. 
Age was mean-centred, and was included as an additive fixed effect. 

Finally, to investigate the role of language exposure, we conducted a third meta-analysis on the subset of CDI production measurements for which language exposure information was available ($n = 20$), including both age and language dominance as moderators.
Language dominance is a measure of the extent to which a child's language exposure is imbalanced, and was operationalised as $\textup{dom} = (50 - \textup{\% non-dominant exposure}) / 100$ such that a 50--50 balanced bilingual would have a dominance of 0, and a hypothetical 100--0 imbalanced bilingual would have a dominance of 0.5.
Dominance was also mean-centred, and also included as an additive fixed effect.

### Results
```{r meta, include=F}
ma_base <- readRDS("models/meta-analysis/ma_base.rds")
ma_age <- readRDS("models/meta-analysis/ma_age.rds")
ma_age_dom <- readRDS("models/meta-analysis/ma_age_dom.rds")
```
Figure \@ref(fig:ma-base) displays the forest plot for the meta-analysis. 
In the full model, the proportion of TE pairs was estimated as `r ma_base$b[1]`% [`r ma_base$ci.lb[1]`, `r ma_base$ci.ub[1]`],^[Brackets indicate 95% confidence intervals.] reliably greater than zero ($p$ `r ma_base$pval[1] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`). 
There was significant heterogeneity ($Q(34)=$ `r ma_base$QE`, $p$ `r ma_base$QEp[1] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`), with contributions from between-report variance ($\sigma^2_1 =$ `r ma_base$sigma2[1]`) and between-measurement variance ($\sigma^2_3 =$ `r ma_base$sigma2[3]`), but not between-participant group variance ($\sigma^2_2 =$ `r ma_base$sigma2[2] |> apa_num()`).

```{r ma-base, out.width="100%", fig.cap="(ref:ma-base-cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics("index/figure/ma_base.pdf", error = FALSE)
```

For the model run on the CDI production subset with age as a moderator, the proportion of TE pairs was estimated as `r ma_age$b[1]`% [`r ma_age$ci.lb[1]`, `r ma_age$ci.ub[1]`], reliably greater than zero ($p$ `r ma_age$pval[1] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`). 
Age was a reliable predictor of the proportion of TE pairs ($\beta =$ `r ma_age$beta[2]` [`r ma_age$ci.lb[2]`, `r ma_age$ci.ub[2]`], $p$ `r ma_age$pval[2] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`). 
This moderator explained some heterogeneity ($Q_M(1) =$ `r ma_age$QM`, $p$ `r ma_age$QMp[1] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`), but there was remaining residual heterogeneity ($Q_E(25) =$ `r ma_age$QE`, $p$ `r ma_age$QEp[1] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`). 
There remained between-report variance ($\sigma^2_1 =$ `r ma_age$sigma2[1]`), along with between-participant group variance ($\sigma^2_2 =$ `r ma_age$sigma2[2]`), although between-measurement variance was estimated at $\sigma^2_3 =$ `r ma_age$sigma2[3]`. 

Finally, for the model run on the CDI production subset with both age and language dominance as moderators, the proportion of TE pairs was estimated as `r ma_age_dom$b[1]`% [`r ma_age_dom$ci.lb[1]`, `r ma_age_dom$ci.ub[1]`], reliably greater than zero ($p$ `r ma_age_dom$pval[1] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`). 
Age was a reliable predictor of the proportion of TE pairs ($\beta =$ `r ma_age_dom$beta[2]` [`r ma_age_dom$ci.lb[2]`, `r ma_age_dom$ci.ub[2]`], $p$ `r ma_age_dom$pval[2] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`). 
However, dominance did not predict the proportion of TE pairs ($\beta =$ `r ma_age_dom$beta[3]` [`r ma_age_dom$ci.lb[3]`, `r ma_age_dom$ci.ub[3]`], $p$ `r ma_age_dom$pval[3] |> apa_p(add_equals=T)`).

### Discussion
The results of the meta-analysis suggest that a good proportion of bilingual children's vocabularies comprise TE pairs. 
Additionally, age is an important moderator variable, such that older children have a greater proportion of TE pairs, corroborating previous research suggesting a relationship between age and TE pairs. 
However, one methodological limitation regarding age is that the variability in age varied across studies---for example, the study in @bilsonSemanticFacilitationBilingual2015 included participants who were 6.28--92.14 months old, whereas Experiment 1 in @weatherheadRoleAudiovisualSpeech2021 had participants who were 23.33--24.76 months old. 
As such, the mean age of participants may not be equally meaningful across different studies as a summary of the participants, which is important as age is an individual-level predictor rather than a group-level predictor.

Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity among measurements, particularly at the between-report level, even when accounting for age as a moderator.
Such heterogeneity may be caused by a number of reasons, including variance in administration methods between different research groups.
However, this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that most of the studies (and in fact all of the studies in the age-moderated models) employ the use of the CDI, which has a relatively simple administrative procedure.
A much more likely source of variation is due to differences in populations; this is supported by the presence of between-participant group variance in the age-moderated model, even within reports.
This result again aligns with the variability across children in previous research.

```{r dom-var}
dom_var <- data_df |> 
  filter(`C/P` == "P",
         `Vocab instrument` == "CDI",
         !is.na(dominance)) |> 
  pull(dominance) |> 
  var()
```

Surprisingly, language exposure---one such dimension of variability---did not predict proportion of TE pairs. 
This may be due in part to the fact that mean language dominance exhibited very low variance ($\sigma^2$ `r dom_var |> apa_num(add_equals=T)`), resulting in relatively low signal-to-noise ratio.
Additionally, similar to age, the variability of language exposure across participants also varied across studies, such that the mean language exposure may not have described the different studies to the same effectiveness (again remembering that it is an individual-level and not a group-level predictor).

On the whole, the results of the meta-analysis support the phenomena described in the literature, demonstrating significant heterogeneity with age as a moderator.
Nonetheless, more detailed study is required to identify the actual contributions of age and language exposure to bilingual word learning, particularly to account for between-child variability, which may have been lost in the meta-analysis by using mean values as a summary of these variables.
One natural extension would be to use a more fine-grained analysis examining the role of these factors on TE production at the level of individual CDI administrations (i.e., examining how age and language exposure affect the proportion of TE pairs in a child's vocabulary).
We report the results of this analysis in the Appendix in the interests of transparency; however, as is the case for the meta-analysis, the baseline problem remains a fundamental limitation of this approach. 
Thus, it is not clear whether the contribution of age is valid or spurious, prompting a more detailed look at the role of age in TE acquisition in bilingual children. 
As such, in Study 2, we move to item-level analyses to investigate the role of TEs in word learning, and whether its effect is affected by age, language exposure, and other variables.
